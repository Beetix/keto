# Note

ORY Keto is still a `sandbox` project.
This makes the included api version `v1` subject
to have breaking changes until the `v1.0.0` release of Keto!

> - AuthZ – **Authorization** is establishing privilege
> - AuthN – Authentication is establishing the identity, which Keto does not do.
>   - See [ORY Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra).
